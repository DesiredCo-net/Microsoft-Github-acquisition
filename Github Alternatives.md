The heart of the issue is healthy competition (indeed, the anti-trust proceedings against Microsoft in the 90's were focused on that problem).
It is very understandable Github's market-share and Microsoft's industry dominace would make this asquisition scary for those who value 
Github's independance.

To that end, here is a partial, alphabetical list of alternatives to github:

Provider | Git Hosting | PR / Code Review |  Issues / Project Management | Collaboration / Teams | Community / Social network | Documentation | Open Source | Decentralized | Extensibility API | Federation | Mattermost/Matrix/Riot Integration | Available online instance | Self-hosting (own premises) | Continuous Integration / Deployment | Project Webhosting | Private Repos | Free of charge | Ccommunity Development | Scalablity | High availability
