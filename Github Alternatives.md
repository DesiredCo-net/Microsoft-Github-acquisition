The heart of the issue is healthy competition (indeed, the anti-trust proceedings against Microsoft in the 90's were focused on that problem).
It is very understandable Github's market-share and Microsoft's industry dominace would make this asquisition scary for those who value 
Github's independance.

To that end, here is a partial, alphabetical list of alternatives to github:
