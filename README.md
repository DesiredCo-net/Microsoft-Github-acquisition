# Motivation for this repo
In response to the [IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT) repo, there is a need for open-minded discussion about all aspects of the issue.

The owner of said repo has chosen to be very heavy-handed [deleteing comments](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/13#event-1661366434), [blocking](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/13#event-1661399910), and even [closing](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/30)/[editing](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/28)/[hiding](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/16) entire threads by users who offer criticism. They are actively discouraging discourse and seem solely focused on gaining popularity for their own means.

The goal here is to offer a more balanced discussion with much less rheotoric from either side.
