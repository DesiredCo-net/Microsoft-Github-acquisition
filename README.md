# Microsoft Github acquisition
Information &amp; debate about the acquisition

# Purpose
In response to the [IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT) repo, there is a need for open-minded discussion about all aspects of the issue.

The owner of said repo has chosen to be very heavy-handed [deleteing comments](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/13#event-1661366434), [blocking](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/13#event-1661399910), and even [closing](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/30)/[editing](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/28)/[hiding](https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/16) entire threads by users who offer criticism. They are actively discouraging discourse and seem solely focusedon gaining popularity for their own means.

This repo will accept all sides of the issue and we encourage linking to in-depth analysis and discussion.
