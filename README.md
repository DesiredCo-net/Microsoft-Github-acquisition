# Motivation for this repo
In response to the [IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT](https://web.archive.org/web/20180606152455/https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT) repo, there is a need for open-minded discussion about all aspects of the issue.

The owner of said repo has chosen to be very heavy-handed [deleting comments](https://web.archive.org/web/20180606152455/https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/13#event-1661366434), [blocking](https://web.archive.org/web/20180606152455/https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/13#event-1661399910), [closing](https://web.archive.org/web/20180606152455/https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/30)/[editing](https://web.archive.org/web/20180606152455/https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/28)/[hiding](https://web.archive.org/web/20180606152455/https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT/issues/16) entire threads by users who offer criticism, and even completely disabling the issues page when people (Good, productive people) repeatedly pushed for sanity. They are actively discouraging discourse and seem solely focused on gaining popularity for their own means.

The goal here is to offer a more balanced discussion with much less rheotoric from either side.
